        <p>I'm glad you are curious and want to know more about me. Here is the rest about me.
            Let's start with my name: Aung Aung. Strange isnt it? Aung means successful. Like every parents in the whole world, my parents want to see me sucessful so they decided Aung Aung.
            because one Aung is not enough. They wanted to make sure by adding another Aung. 
            I'm from Burma or Myanmar. The country is located in SouthEast Asia. it's a big country (the size of Texas!) but not many people know about it. 
            Don't worry, I'm here to tell about it. People from Myanmar or Burma don't have first name, middle, and last name. We have a whole name.
            Before I came to us, people told me that having first and last name was a must. So i decided to split my name. 
            My parents decided to come to U.S when we were living in Thailand refugee camp provided by UN. We lived there for many years.
            Finally, we moved to U.S in 2007. I saw the good and bad, the culture shocks, and new socail experience living in U.S.
            I went to community college for 2 years and a few months. I work through my high school years and community college years until I joined the U.S Marine Corps!
            I got a chance to travel and explore Spain and Italy during my 9 months deployment.</p>
