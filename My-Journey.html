        <p>I like gaming. only League of Legend
            Working out. Running, biking. learning about cultures around the world. 
            These things are what I do daily. I like to see and learn people around the world through youtube documentary, food channel, and other form of medias for now.
            I would be traveling one day as I'm financially stable and free.</p>
